Phishing URL Detection Using Machine Learning
Phishing is a form of fraudulent attack where the attacker tries to gain sensitive information by posing as a reputable source. In a typical phishing attack, a victim opens a compromised link that poses as a credible website. The victim is then asked to enter their credentials, but since it is a "fake" website, the sensitive information is routed to the hacker and the victim gets "hacked". Phishing is popular since it is a low effort, high reward attack. Most modern web browsers, antivirus software and email clients are pretty good at detecting phishing websites at the source, helping to prevent attacks.

A fraudulent domain or phishing domain is an URL scheme that looks suspicious for a variety of reasons. Most commonly, the URL: 
1.Is misspelled
2.Points to the wrong top-level domain
3.A combination of a valid and a fraudulent URL
4.Is incredibly long 
5.Is just be an IP address
6.Has a low pagerank
